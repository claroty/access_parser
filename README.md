# AccessDB Parser (Pure Python)
Microsoft Access (.mdb / .accdb) database files parser. The parsing logic is fully written in python and works without any external binary dependencies.

# Installing
Use pip: `pip install access-parser`

Or install manually:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ClarotyICS/access_parser.git
cd access_parser

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv # On Windows use: py -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install using pip (modern approach)
pip install .

# Verify installation
python -c "import access_parser; print('Installed successfully')"
```

# Usage Example
```python
from access_parser import AccessParser

# .mdb or .accdb file
db = AccessParser("/path/to/mdb/file.mdb")

# Print DB tables
print(db.catalog)

# Tables are stored as defaultdict(list) -- table[column][row_index]
table = db.parse_table("table_name")

# Pretty print all tables
db.print_database()

```

### Known Issues
* 

This library was tested on a limited subset of database files. Due to the differences between database versions and the complexity of the parsing we expect to find more parsing edge-cases.

To help us resolve issues faster please provide as much data as you can when opening an issue - DB file if possible and full trace including log messages.
 
 
### Thanks
* This library was made possible by the great work by mdb-tools. The logic in this library heavily relies on the excellent documentation they have https://github.com/brianb/mdbtools
* Huge thanks to Mashav Sapir for the help debugging, CRing and contributing to this project https://github.com/mashavs
